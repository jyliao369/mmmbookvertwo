## Project Title: mmm!!Book

  ## Description:
  This project is a updated version of a previous project I worked on. In both projects, user can create and add recipes for other users to see and recreate. Recipes ranged from drinks and beverages to main entrees and desserts. Recipes can range from different cuisines from around the world. Users can create an account and upload recipes they have created or even save recipes created by other users. All information about the recipe is provided ranging from prep time to total cook time to ingredients and the instructions to recreate the dish. users can also leave a review and a rating from one to five stars.

  ## Installation
  -- What technologies did the application require in order to run smoothly and effectively?--

  The application is a typical MERN stack application with a few minor adjustments. The front-end uses React and Javascript. The back-end uses Node and Express to make calls and requests. The main difference is instead of MongoDB for its database, the application uses MySQL. The database server is hosted by Heroku and the Front-end is hosted with GitHub Pages. Styling is done with pure CSS.

  ## Complete/Finished?
  -- Is the application finished/complete? --

  No the application is not complete.

  ## What's Missing?
  -- If incomplete, what is the application missing? --

  The application should be able to showcase the number of reviews, likes and bookmarks based on how many users. Users are lacking a total review score based on reviews generated by other users.

  ## Improvements
  -- Does the application need improvements and what are they? --

  Yes there are many other improvements needed. An update function is needed if users want to update a recipe they created. Another important function to be added is the ability to take a users created recipe and make any adjustments one would want to make. 

  ## Future Ideas

  The front-end styling needs adjustment to give it more style and more responsiveness to make the application compatible with desktop and mobile platforms.
